# Vercel Deployment Summary

## Files Created/Modified

1. **vercel.json** - Main configuration file for Vercel deployment
2. **api/index.js** - Vercel serverless function handler for API routes
3. **index.html** - Root HTML file for the frontend
4. **VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Detailed deployment instructions
5. **DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## Configuration Details

### vercel.json
- Configured to build both frontend and backend
- Routes API requests to `/api/*` to the serverless function
- All other requests are handled by the main server
- Uses `npm run build` as the build command
- Outputs built files to `dist/public`

### API Handler (api/index.js)
- Uses express with serverless-http for Vercel compatibility
- Imports and registers all existing API routes
- Includes CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Handles JSON and URL-encoded request bodies

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy using Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   - `DB_HOST` - Database host
   - `DB_PORT` - Database port (usually 3306)
   - `DB_USER` - Database username
   - `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
   - `DB_NAME` - Database name
   - `SESSION_SECRET` - Secret for session management

## Important Notes

1. This is a full-stack application with both frontend and backend
2. The application requires a MySQL database
3. API routes are available under `/api/` prefix
4. Static frontend files are built to `dist/public`
5. Session management uses in-memory store (consider Redis for production)

## Next Steps

1. Push code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import project in Vercel dashboard
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy and test the application
