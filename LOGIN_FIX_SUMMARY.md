# Login Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
User reported "failed to login" to the web application.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Frontend Proxy Configuration Missing**: The Vite frontend was not properly configured to communicate with the backend API
2. **Backend Port Configuration Issue**: The backend was configured to run on port 3000 instead of port 5000
3. **Docker Container Dependencies**: The frontend was trying to start before the backend was fully running

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Frontend Proxy Configuration
Updated `vite.config.ts` to include proxy configuration for API requests:
```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    "/api": {
      target: "http://localhost:5000",
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    },
  },
}
```

### 2. Fixed Backend Port Configuration
Updated `server/index.ts` to run the backend on port 5000:
```typescript
// ALWAYS serve the app on port 5000 for the backend API
// Port 3000 is reserved for the frontend
const port = 5000;
```

### 3. Updated Docker Configuration
Modified `docker-compose.fullstack.yml` to properly configure:
- Backend API on port 5000
- Frontend on port 3000
- Proper dependency chain (frontend depends on backend, backend depends on database)

## Current Status
1. Database container is running and healthy
2. Backend container is installing dependencies and will start on port 5000
3. Frontend container is running and will proxy API requests to the backend

## Test Credentials
Once the system is fully running, you can test login with:
- **Teacher**: prof.smith@ustp.edu.ph / password123
- **Student**: alice.doe@student.ustp.edu.ph / password123

## Next Steps
1. Wait for backend dependencies to finish installing
2. Verify backend is serving on port 5000
3. Test login functionality through the web interface at http://localhost:3000
