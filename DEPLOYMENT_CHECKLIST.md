# Docker Application Deployment Checklist

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### 1. Code Preparation
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables are configurable
- [ ] Update database connection strings to use environment variables
- [ ] Verify the application builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [ ] Test locally using `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up`
- [ ] Create .env file with production values
- [ ] Update any hardcoded URLs or ports

### 2. Security Review
- [ ] Change default passwords in production environment
- [ ] Generate a strong SESSION_SECRET
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not hardcoded
- [ ] Review database permissions
- [ ] Check for any development-only configurations

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize Docker image size
- [ ] Ensure proper health checks are in place
- [ ] Configure resource limits if supported by the platform
- [ ] Review database indexing
- [ ] Check caching strategies

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Choose Deployment Platform
- [ ] Select cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- [ ] Create account if needed
- [ ] Install required CLI tools

### 2. Prepare Application
- [ ] Clone or push code to repository
- [ ] Build Docker images
- [ ] Test images locally

### 3. Configure Environment
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure database connection
- [ ] Set up domain names if needed
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates

### 4. Deploy Application
- [ ] Follow platform-specific deployment instructions
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs
- [ ] Verify services start correctly

### 5. Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Test all application features
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Check API endpoints
- [ ] Test user authentication
- [ ] Verify static assets are served correctly

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Database
- [ ] Some platforms provide managed databases (use if available)
- [ ] Consider using external database service for better reliability
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure proper database scaling

### Networking
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up load balancing if needed
- [ ] Configure DNS settings
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up application monitoring
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical issues
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring

## Rollback Plan
- [ ] Document current working version
- [ ] Keep backup of previous deployment
- [ ] Test rollback procedure
- [ ] Ensure database migrations can be reverted

## Maintenance
- [ ] Schedule regular backups
- [ ] Plan for regular updates
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Set up automated testing for updates

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Database Connection Issues
- Check environment variables
- Verify network connectivity
- Confirm database is accepting connections

### Build Failures
- Check Dockerfile for errors
- Verify all dependencies are available
- Ensure build context is correct

### Runtime Issues
- Check application logs
- Verify environment configuration
- Confirm resource allocation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Application is accessible via web browser
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] Database operations succeed
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security measures are in place
