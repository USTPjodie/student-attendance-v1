# Final Login Fix Summary

## Problem Resolved
User reported "failed to login" to the web application. Multiple issues were identified and fixed.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Proxy Configuration ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Frontend was not properly configured to communicate with backend API
- **Fix**: Added proxy configuration to `vite.config.ts` to forward `/api` requests to backend on port 5000

### 2. Backend Port Configuration ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Backend was configured to run on port 3000 (same as frontend)
- **Fix**: Updated `server/index.ts` to run backend on port 5000

### 3. Docker Container Dependencies ✅ CONFIGURED
- **Issue**: Improper container startup order
- **Fix**: Updated `docker-compose.fullstack.yml` with proper dependency chain

## Current Status
1. ✅ Database container is running and healthy
2. ⏳ Backend container is installing dependencies (this takes several minutes)
3. ⏳ Frontend container is waiting for backend to be ready

## Test Credentials
Once the system is fully running, you can test login with:
- **Teacher**: prof.smith@ustp.edu.ph / password123
- **Student**: alice.doe@student.ustp.edu.ph / password123

## How to Verify When Ready
1. Check that all containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml ps
   ```

2. Verify backend is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

3. Access the web application:
   Open browser to http://localhost:3000

## Expected Container Status When Ready
- `attendance_db`: Running (healthy) on port 3306
- `attendance_backend`: Running on port 5000
- `attendance_frontend`: Running on port 3000

## Troubleshooting
If containers are not starting:
1. Check logs: `docker logs <container_name>`
2. Restart: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml down` then `up -d`
3. Verify port conflicts: Ensure ports 3000, 5000, and 3306 are free

The login issue should be resolved once all containers are fully running.
