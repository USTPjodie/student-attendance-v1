# Login Test Summary

## Issue
User reported "failed to login" to the web application.

## Investigation
1. Verified that Docker containers are running properly
2. Confirmed that the database contains the proper user data:
   - Teacher: prof.smith@ustp.edu.ph / password123
   - Student: alice.doe@student.ustp.edu.ph / password123
3. Identified that the frontend was missing proxy configuration to communicate with the backend
4. Added proxy configuration to vite.config.ts to forward /api requests to the backend
5. Restarted the Docker containers with the updated configuration

## Fixes Applied
1. Updated vite.config.ts to include proxy configuration for API requests
2. Verified that all containers (database, backend, frontend) are running
3. Confirmed that the proper user data exists in the database

## Next Steps
1. Wait for the backend to finish starting up (installing dependencies)
2. Test the login functionality through the web interface
3. If issues persist, check the backend logs for any errors during startup

## Test Credentials
- Teacher login: prof.smith@ustp.edu.ph / password123
- Student login: alice.doe@student.ustp.edu.ph / password123
