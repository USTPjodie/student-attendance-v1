# üéâ Web App Running Successfully in Docker!

Congratulations! Your web application is now running successfully in Docker containers. Here's everything you need to know:

## ‚úÖ Current Status

- **MySQL Database**: ‚úÖ Running on port 3306
- **Node.js Application**: ‚úÖ Running on port 3000
- **API Endpoints**: ‚úÖ Accessible and working
- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Serving static files
- **Database Connection**: ‚úÖ Successfully established

## üöÄ How to Use

### Start the Application
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml up -d
```

### Check Container Status
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml ps
```

### Access the Application
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/api/health
- **Database**: Accessible on localhost:3306

### View Logs
```bash
# View all logs
docker logs attendance_app
docker logs attendance_db

# View recent logs
docker logs attendance_app --tail 50
docker logs attendance_db --tail 50
```

### Stop Containers
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml down
```

## üîß Working Endpoints

1. **Health Check**: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/health`
   - Returns: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-04T01:51:02.537Z"}`

2. **Main Web Page**: `GET http://localhost:3000`
   - Returns: The main HTML page with React application

## üìÅ Key Files

1. **docker-compose.api.yml** - Main docker-compose file for running the application
2. **Dockerfile** - Multi-stage Dockerfile for building the application
3. **server/index.ts** - Main application entry point
4. **server/schema.sql** - Database schema initialization

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check if containers are running**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml ps
   ```

2. **View detailed logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs attendance_app --follow
   ```

3. **Restart containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml down
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Test API health**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

## üìä Database Information

- **Database Name**: student_attendance
- **Username**: appuser
- **Password**: apppassword
- **Root Password**: rootpassword
- **Host**: db (from within containers), localhost (from host)

## üéØ Success!

Your Docker setup is complete and working. The web application is accessible at http://localhost:3000 and all database connections are functioning properly.

# Docker Web Application Running Successfully

## Issue Summary
The web application was not running properly in Docker even though logs showed it was serving on port 3000. The issue was that the frontend was running on Vite's default port (5173) instead of port 3000, and the Docker configuration was not properly set up to run both the backend and frontend services.

## Root Cause
1. The frontend service was configured to run Vite on its default port (5173) instead of port 3000
2. The docker-compose configuration was not properly separating the backend and frontend services
3. The frontend was not properly configured to communicate with the backend API

## Solution Implemented
1. Created a proper docker-compose configuration (`docker-compose.fullstack.yml`) that separates the backend and frontend services:
   - Backend API runs on port 5000
   - Frontend runs on port 3000
   - Database runs on port 3306

2. Updated the frontend service command to explicitly run Vite on port 3000:
   ```bash
   npx vite --host --port 3000
   ```

3. Configured proper environment variables for API communication:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - NODE_ENV=development
     - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Verification
The web application is now successfully running and accessible at http://localhost:3000. The backend API is accessible at http://localhost:5000, and the database is running on port 3306.

## How to Run
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml up -d
```

To stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.fullstack.yml down
```

## Services
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000
- Database: localhost:3306
